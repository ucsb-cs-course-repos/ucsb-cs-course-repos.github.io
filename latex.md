The software underlying Github Pages, Jekyll, includes support for math notation expressed in LaTeX syntax.

# How to enable it

1.  Be sure that this line appears in `_config.yml`
    ```
    TODO: Fill this in
    ```

2.  Be sure that the following JavaScript file is loaded somewhere in your layouts:
    ```
    TODO: fill this in
    ```
    

# How to use it

To put LaTeX notation in your files use the `$$ latex notation here $$` syntax, for example:

```
FILL THIS IN
```
