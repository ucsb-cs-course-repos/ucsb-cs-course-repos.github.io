To run locally, you need to:

1. Install `rvm` (the Ruby Version Manager)
2. Have an up-to-date `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`
3. Have an up-to-date `setup.sh` file that you run once:
   * each time you clone the repo on a new system
   * any time the versions of Ruby or the modules used by github-pages change
4. Have an up-to-date `jekyll.sh` that you run each time you want to preview the site on <http://localhost:4000>
