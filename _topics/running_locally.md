To run locally, you need to:

1. Install `rvm` (the Ruby Version Manager)
 * See instructions here: [/topics/running_locally_rvm/](/topics/running_locally_rvm/)
2. Have an up-to-date `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`
 * See instructions here: [/topics/running_locally_gemfile/](/topics/running_locally_gemfile/)
3. Have an up-to-date `setup.sh` file that you run once:
   * each time you clone the repo on a new system
   * any time the versions of Ruby or the modules used by github-pages change
   * See instructions here: [/topics/running_locally_setup_sh/](/topics/running_locally_setup_sh/)
4. Have an up-to-date `jekyll.sh` that you run each time you want to preview the site on <http://localhost:4000>
   * See instructions here: [/topics/running_locally_jekyll_sh/](/topics/running_locally_jeykll_sh/)
