topic: "Boilerplate: "
desc: "Updating the boilerplate files that should be the same in every repo"
---

Every repo that follows this theme has some boilerplate files in them that are needed to pull in the most current versions of the software.

Periodically, these need to be updated to the latest verisons (usually this is to address security vulnerabilities; rarely, it is to
enable new features or fix bugs.)

The repo [ucsb-cs-course-repos/boilerplate](https://github.com/ucsb-cs-course-repos/boilerplate] contains both these files, and a script
to update your repo to the latest versions.

# How to update your repo to the latest versions

If you maintain a course website, you may periodically need to do this, especially if you see that the site is not building properly on Travis-CI,
or that Github is reporting security vulnerabilities.
