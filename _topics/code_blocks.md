# The simplest thing (this always works)

If you put code inside a block starting and ending with {% raw %}```{% endraw %}, it will render as code:


You write:

{% raw %}
```
# This is Python code
print ("Hello, World")
```
{% endraw %}

You get:

```
# This is Python code
print ("Hello, World")
```

# Syntax Highlighting

If you have things set up properly, you can get fancier, with syntax highlighting for specific languages, line numbers, 
and so forth.

You write:

{% raw %}
```python
# This is Python code
print ("Hello, World")
```
{% endraw %}

You get:

```python
# This is Python code
print ("Hello, World")
```
