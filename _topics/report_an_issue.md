If you are using a course repo that uses the `ucsb-cs-course-repos/course-repo-jekyll-theme`
and you:
* find a bug
* want to request a feature
* want to request documentation on "how to do a thing"

You can do so by adding an issue here:
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs-course-repos/course-repo-jekyll-theme/issues>

If you don't have the authority to add issues there, you can also contact `phtcon@ucsb.edu`

Phill
