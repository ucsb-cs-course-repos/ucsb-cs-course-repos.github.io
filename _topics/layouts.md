The `_layouts` directory contains templates for the various html renderings of pages on your site.

You typically will have a default layout, i.e. `default.html`, but then might have variations on that
for items from particular collections, such as homework assignments, labs, exams, lecture notes, handouts etc.

These might vary in terms of some common information at the top or bottom of the page, and/or whether they are
intended primarily for the browser, or to be printed.

# A typical `default.html`

```html

```
