If you want to use Github for a course, it is a good practice to:
* set up an organization for the course
* request an academic discount for that organziation.

# Benefits (basic)

These benefits flow easily and automatically from using github in this way

* It allows the creation of unlimited private repos to which the *instructional staff automatically has full access*


# Benefits (advanced)

These benefits require some additional programming of custom software

* Having students belong to an organization provides a way to differentiate students in the course, and instructional staff, from others when using Github OAuth as a login mechanism for a webapp
* Having students create repos under an organization allows central management of "github hooks" to help manage, record, and structure students interactions with github
