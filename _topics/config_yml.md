The file `_config.yml` is the main file that controls the process 
by which the Jekyll software generates
a website from the source files.

The configuration for `_config.yml` is divided into three parts,
each of which has it's own set of documentation:

* [`_config.yml`: common]({{ '/topics/config_yml_common/' | relative_url}}) settings that are common to both course and offering level sites
* [`_config.yml`: course]({{ '/topics/config_yml_course/' | relative_url }}) settings for course level sites
* [`_config.yml`: offering]({{ '/topics/config_yml_offering/' | relative_url }}) settings for offering level sites
