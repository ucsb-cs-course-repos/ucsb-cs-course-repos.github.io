# A few basic ideas

## Two websites in one

* For each course offering, we have two websites we work with:
   * One that stays the same across course offerings, e.g. <https://ucsb-cs16.github.io>
   * One that is new every quarter, e.g. <https://ucsb-cs16-wi17.github.io>, <https://ucsb-cs16-sp17.github.io>
* The two websites are integrated via common navigation so that they appear to the end user as if they are one big website.

## Terminology

* 'Markdown' is the format we use to author more course materials
* 'Jekyll' is the software that is used to convert Markdown into static HTML
* 'Github Pages' is used to host the Jekyll formatted site

You don't have to use github pages, and are not locked into using github pages.  It is possible to host Jekyll-based websites on other platforms, including
Heroku.      You typically only need to do that if you need to restrict access to some parts of the site based on OAuth login.   We don't discuss that further in this getting started article.
