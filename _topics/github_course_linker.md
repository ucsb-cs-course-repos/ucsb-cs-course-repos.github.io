We have a UCSB home-grown tool that allows instructors to set up a Github Course
organization, link it to a course roster, and then give students the ability to
join that course organization directly.    This avoids the administrative overhead
of having course staff have to add in each student one at a time, or write their own
script to do it.    

The tool is here:

If you are an instructor and need access, contact Phill.
