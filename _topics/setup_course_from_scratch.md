# Step 1: Create github organization

For UCSB CS, our naming convention is, for example:

* [ucsb-cs8](https://github.com/ucsb-cs8)
* [ucsb-cs16](https://github.com/ucsb-cs16)
* [ucsb-cs111](https://github.com/ucsb-cs111)
etc.

# Step 2: Create Github repo

The github repo MUST follow the Github Pages standard naming convention if you want to host on Github pages

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs8/ucsb-cs8.github.io>
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs24/ucsb-cs24.github.io>
* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs111/ucsb-cs111.github.io>
etc.


# Step 3: Copy in boilerplate files

Follow instructions to [Copy in boilerplate files]({{'/topics/setup_boilerplate/' | relative_url }}).
They all go in the root directory of the repo.

# Step 4: Configure `_config.yml`

Create a file with the name `_config.yml` in the root directory of the repo,
following both sets of instructions below.

The order of items in the `_config.yml` file doesn't matter.

* [`_config.yml` instructions for all repos]({{  | relative_url}})
* [`_config.yml` instructions for course repos]({{  | relative_url}})
