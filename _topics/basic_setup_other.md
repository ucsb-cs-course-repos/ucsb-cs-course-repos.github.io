# Checklist

## Gradescope 

* If you don't want "negative" scoring as default, change default in course settings to "positive"
* If you are reusing materials from an instructor that taught the course before, ask them to make you a TA or instructor
   on their old course so that you have the option to copy over rubrics.

## github

* Choose whether to use github.ucsb.edu or github.com.  There are compelling arguments pro/con for each.
   * TODO: Make a list of the pros/cons.  For now, ask Phill.
* Consider setting up a github organization for your course. 
   * Advantage: make yourself and your grading staff "Owners". 
   * Then you can see into the private repos of the students to help them and gain insight into work in progress.
* If you use an organization, be sure to set the default organization permissions to "None" 
   * Otherwise students that are members of the organization can see one anothers private repos.
   * You probably want only "owners" (i.e. instructional staff) to be able to do that 
* If the organization is on github.com, consider asking for "coupon" so that you can get free private repos.
   * Where: <https://education.github.com> leads to <https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new>
   * Private repos are allowed automatically at <https://github.ucsb.edu>
* Consider using <https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com/> as a way of allowing students on your course roster
   to self-enroll in a github organization.
